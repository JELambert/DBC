# The Spiked Boots - The Storm Before the Storm Chapter 11 Summary

**This chapter gave insights into Marius' troops, named as 'The Spiked Boots', and various political dynamics of Rome.** 

* **Cinna's Rise to Power**: An individual named Lucius Cornelius Cinna emerged unexpectedly and became the most powerful person in Rome for about three years. It is believed he might have fought in several wars under Marius and Sulla. Cinna was elected as a consul and was instrumental in managing the affairs of Rome. He was ousted from Rome at one point by a more conservative consul, Octavius. Cinna rallied Italian allies across the countryside to come back to power.

* **Role of Marius and The Spiked Boots**: Amidst this power struggle, Marius composed a group of veterans or mercenaries known as 'The Spiked Boots'. Marius, with his cold-blooded mercenaries, managed to gain power alongside Cinna. Read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Career_of_Gaius_Marius) about Marius' military career and 'The Spiked Boots'.

* **Civil war, Plagues and Cinna's Comeback**: As Sulla was fighting Mithridates, he couldn't support the pro-Roman optimates simultaneously. Pompey Magnus' father, Pompey Strabo, attempted to fight Cinna rather than join him as the saviour of Rome. Unfortunately, a plague outbroke killing 10,000 civilians including Pompey Strabo which led to Cinna's comeback.

* **Cinna's Reign and Downfall**: With Marius' 'Spiked Boots' terrorizing Rome, Cinna became the consul again. Sadly, his rise wouldn't last long. As soon as he ventured to meet Sulla, his troops were hit by a storm that led to mass mutiny and Cinna's assassination by his centurion. Thus, as quickly Cinna rose to power, he lost it too. 

* **Legacy of Marius**: Marius won his seventh consulship post this, but died 17 days after it. His life marked significant changes in Rome as he challenged senatorial supremacy, connected to publicani merchants, served as a patron to the poor legion veterans and won wars against Jugurtha and Cimbri. Marius was seen as someone who let his ambition run unbounded. 

* **Sulla's Conquests**: Meanwhile, in the east, Sulla showed considerable success in managing the Pontic Wars. He defeated large armies and forced Mithridates into agreement, regaining all lost Asian cities and making them taxable again. 

All these events marked significant shifts in the political and social dynamics of Rome, leading to newer power equations.
