# Chapter 8: The Third founder of Rome, Gaius Marius

The focus of this chapter is Gaius Marius' rise to hero status within the Roman Republic due to his consistent military victories. His most notable victory was against the **Cimbri**, which had a notable impact on the sociopolitical atmosphere.

At this stage in Rome, there was a sense of emergency due to recent victories by the Cimbri and an ongoing Servile War. *Lucius Appuleius Saturninus*, along with his ally *Gaius Glaucia*, took advantage of this atmosphere. Unlike the Gracchi brothers, who were at the mercy of the mob, Saturninus knew how to manipulate the mob to benefit himself and his populist causes.

Marius' meeting with the Cimbri leads to an eventual battle. They did not believe him when he informed them of their allies' defeat until he produced their king. Marius used a flanking maneuver in the battle, leaving the main fighting to Catilus and Sulla. This tactic resulted in the death of 120,000 Cimbri, effectively eliminating their threat to Rome.

Following these events, Marius earned the title of the **third founder of Rome**, this greatly increased his stature. His fellow consul, *Manius Aquilius*, managed to subdue Sicily's uprising during the **Second Servile War**. When Aquilius shipped all the enslaved people back to Rome, they chose mass suicide over death in animal fights.

During this time another political shift happened, Saturninus attempted to reenact the coalition that existed during the Gracchi brothers' rule, this move to seize land grants and gain the support of army veterans led to a rift between Roman citizens and their Italian allies.

Despite their past alliance, Saturninus lost Marius' support. Saturninus' attempt to use Marius' reverence for the Gracchi and his ambition for Glaucia to occupy a significant position did not sit well with Marius, who still desired noble approval. Saturninus summoned the mob for support leading to Marius being given the Roman senate's prerogative of state preservation.

Using his military tact, Marius cut all water pipe service to the Capitoline, leading to the mob turning against and stoning Saturninus to death, while Glaucia was dragged out of his home and murdered on the streets. Following these events, radical influencers were once again 'dumped' into the Tiber river[^1^]. Although the senate tried to revert some legislation Jupiter passed, not everything could be changed.

The chapter ends on a slightly ominous note, warning about Marius’ ruin due to his relentless pursuit of glory rather opposing retirement as a respected statesman.
