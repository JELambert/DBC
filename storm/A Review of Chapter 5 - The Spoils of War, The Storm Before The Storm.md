# A Review of Chapter 5: The Spoils of War, The Storm Before The Storm

* [The Storm Before The Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_Before_the_Storm) focuses a lot on the **Kimbri tribe**, possibly from modern day Denmark. The tribe targeted **Karbo**, leading to the onset of the **Kimbrian Wars**. Interestingly, the Kimbri opted not to march on Rome, a notable fact in this chapter. 
* The chapter also introduces the **Skordisi Conflict**, resolved successfully by **Marcus Livius Drusus**.
* There are further conflicts in Africa, highlighting another Meteli member, **Quintus Metellus** who took command of the Rome armies against the Numidians. He asked **Gaius Marius**, despite their political differences, to serve as a legate, an impressive backing testament to Marius's abilities.
* Metellus's campaign turned into a prolonged engagement, a significant detail to note.
* Back in Rome, charges were brought against the high optimates to try and curb their prevalent corruption through the **Mamilian Commission**.
* **Gaius Cato** was accused, contributing to a new political climate advantageous to new players like **Gaius Marius**.
* The Kimbri crushed the Roman legions once more, under **Marcus Solanus**, but again refrained from raiding Rome.
* In Africa, Metellus changed tactics, splitting his forces to target Ethiopian communities, introducing an element of guerilla warfare to the conflict.
* One of Jugurtha's lieutenants, **Bomilkar**, initially tried to persuade him to surrender. However, Jugurtha became aware of Bomilkar's betrayal and executed him.
* During this period, Marius ran for consulship, despite Metellus's efforts to maintain his obedience and position.
* Marius's resulting consulship victory was the third blow against the Optimates, following Mimius's attacks in 111 and the Mamilian Commission in 109.
* In a significant move, Marius eliminated property qualifications for joining the army, allowing poor Romans to serve. This resulted in armies loyal to their generals instead of the Roman Republic, a notable hop away from the traditional concept of temporary, conscripted armies.  
* Marius set off to Africa with this new army, among whose ranks was a particular quaestor, **Lucius Cornelius Sulla**, who will be key in upcoming chapters.
