# The Storm Before the Storm, Chapter 1: The Beasts of Italy - Summary

This document provides a detailed summary of chapter one from Mike Duncan's history book, "The Storm Before the Storm" titled, "The Beasts of Italy". The chapter is primarily focused on a pivotal time of political and social transformation in Rome around the time of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus.

## Key Characters

1. **Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus:** Tiberius was the grandson of Scipio Africanus and nephew to Scipio Aemilianus through adoption. He came from a significant political background and was primed for success by his mother, Cornelia. He was initially well-regarded for his attempts to negotiate a peaceful solution with the Spanish but later became reviled by the Senate.
2. **Scipio Aemilianus:** A powerful figure in Rome who held high regard and position. Aemilianus was known to have consolidated power outside of legal boundaries, raising personal armies and getting re-elections. Decidedly an important player in setting a precedent in Rome's political sphere.
3. **Cornelia:** She was Tiberius' mother who had primed him for high political success from an early age. 
4. **Appius Claudius Pulcher:** Well-known senator and Tiberius' father-in-law, he was part of the political conflict that engulfed Rome. 

## Events Leading to Political Violence

During this era, Rome grappled with the growing problem of wealth inequality. Wealthy aristocrats completed land grabs, forcing former landowners into tenant farming and causing significant socioeconomic distress. The conquests of Carthage and Greece created an influx of wealth that was primarily concentrated among the elite.

A proposed land reform bill by Pulcher sought to address this problem by redistributing public lands to the citizens. Pulcher waited for Aemilianus' departure to Spain to put forth this bill. However, Tiberius faced difficulties in passing it due to resistance from another tribune, Marcus Octavius, leading to a cycle of escalating reprisals between the two factions. It culminates in Tiberius getting deposed from his office due to a bill, and him running for reelection, perceived as a significant power grab by senate members. 

This political tension met a violent end when senator Nassica led a mob to massacre 300 people, including Tiberius, due to the land bill. This action, far from being condemned, set a new precedent of violence in Roman politics.

## Consequences

The violence that erupted changed the course of Rome's political and social culture by legitimating the use of force as a political tool and pitting the richer masses against the poorer ones. Duncan suggests that once such a drastic tactic is used and condoned, it makes it easier for others to follow suit, thereby changing the way politics is conducted.
