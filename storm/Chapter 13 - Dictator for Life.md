# Chapter 13: Dictator for Life

Today's discussion centers around Sulla's reign as Dictator, his tactics, impacts and ultimately his legacy. Key topics discussed include Sulla's use of terror, his reforms to try to restore senatorial aristocracy rule, and the subsequent downfall of those reforms.

#### Sulla's Reign

- Sulla's victory in the Civil War shifted his approach from being somewhat magnanimous to adopting a reign of terror. 
- Illustrative of this change was his address to the Senate where 6000 Samnite prisoners were being killed only feet away, allowing their screams to serve as the backdrop for his speech. 
- He marked people for death; first posting 80 names, then 220, followed by 500.  These individuals were essentially marked for death.  
- Pompey's infamous quote in Sicily while pursuing Carbo highlights the period's brutal nature: "Cease quoting laws to us that have swords" [[Pompey's_quote_in_Sicily]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey#cite_note-36).

#### Sulla's Moves to Restore Senatorial Aristocracy

- Upon becoming dictator for life, an anomaly for hundreds of years in Rome, Sulla embarked on reforms aimed at restoring senatorial aristocracy.
- He targeted tribunes, equestrians, and publicani, effectively removing their power. His objective was to restore senatorial domination as the ruling power. 
- His laws crumbled rather quickly after stepping down, showing a significant limitation to his impact.

#### Sulla's Legacy

- Sulla's legacy was underpinned more by his actions demonstrating what could be done (attaining power) rather than what should be done (honoring moral or societal norms). 
- His belief that senatorial domination was the solution was misguided - rather it was a cause of the problems Rome was facing.
- The reforms were well-intentioned but didn't address the root causes of Rome's problems. 

### Final Thoughts

- It's important to highlight the complexity and multifaceted nature of this period. Initiatives such as land redistribution efforts, the rise of the equestrians, the dramatic increase in power for individuals like Crassus, Pompey and Caesar, all factored into the period's turbulent dynamics.
- Caesar, drawing on his connections to Marius and leveraging popular sympathies was highly successful in his political career, whereas Sulla's laws and reforms gained little traction in the long run.
- Another critical event of this time was the death of Crassus which fractured the alliance between Caesar and Pompey, contributing to the further destabilization of the Republic.
- Caesar subsequently became the dictator for life in 49 until his murder. Pompey, on the other hand, partnered with the optimates in the Senate, leading to renewed periods of conflict in Rome.
- Ultimately, out of the civil wars emerged Octavian, who transformed the Republic into the Roman Empire as Augustus.
- This period marked a stark deviation from Polybius's constitution theory with the triumphant Caesars not necessarily leading to an aristocratic response but rather to a shift of power to the provincials and equestrians.

This chapter concludes our discourse on this period of Roman history, which was marked by significant socio-political changes, including the transition from Republic to Empire. It's an era that hints at the fragility and transitory nature of political systems, and the impact of leadership styles on societal progression and conflict.
