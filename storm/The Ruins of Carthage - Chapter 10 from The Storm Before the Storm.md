# The Ruins of Carthage - Chapter 10 from The Storm Before the Storm

This chapter focuses on the fall of Marius and particularly, the rise of Mithridates, as a considerable adversary to Roman aggression. In a detailed examination, this chapter presents history as it unfolded within the confines of Rome and the vast expanses of Asia. 

## Key Figures
- **Marius:** A fading hero of Rome, Marius has his sunset moments in this chapter. While he wanted to subjugate Mithridates, age was against him, and he was dismissed by Rome who was not used to sending 70-year-olds to war. He, however, still attempted to assert his readiness for battle, even doing jumping jacks in the Rome forum.
- **Mithridates** (Read More: [Mithridates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus)): Born into a heroic upbringing, Mithridates dodged several assassination attempts by his mother, who preferred his younger brother. He eventually rose to become the leader of the Pontic army, catalyzing a reign of power that posed a formidable challenge to Rome. Mithridates utilized the abuses of publicani's against the Asian cities, under Roman control, as a weapon of propaganda.
- **Sulla Metellan Faction:** Sulla, another powerful figure in Rome, wanted control of the Metellan Faction, left in turmoil following the death of its leader, Metella's husband, Scaris. Despite an age gap which caused initial confusion, Sulla secured a marriage to Metella.
- **Sculpius:** Sculpius is a notable character who is said to have invented what is known as the professional gang meant for the streets. 

We see that while Sulla and Marius are prominent Romans with significant power, Mithridates is the emerging, powerful enemy from the East. His capture of Aquilius, sent to him by Rome, merely fueled his rapid rise to power. 

Mithridates succeeded in aligning several of the Asian cities against the Romans through strategic use of publicani's abuses. This culminated in the brutal mass execution of 80,000 Italians in the Asian cities, a shocking genocide that tied these Asian cities with Mithridates. 

During this tenure, Marius, Sulla, and Sculpius also fight power battles in Rome. However, they face an unprecedented opposition. Sulla marches six loyal legions towards Rome, crossing a sacred line of bringing arms into the forum. Despite this act of political violence, Marius was uninspiring in his response and found himself deposed and hiding in a swamp. 

Interestingly, he is said to be in the ruins of Carthage during this altercation, surviving multiple capture attempts because none wanted to kill the demagogue of Roman society, which highlights the struggle and tombstone-like silence that ensues within this historically-rich chapter.

The essay ends on a dismal note, detailing the massive genocide committed by Mithridates, a fatal flaw that would eventually lead to his downfall.
