# Chapter 9: Italia - The Storm Before the Storm

This chapter introduces **Quintus Silo**, the leader of the Italian Uprising during the Social War. Silo was aligned with **Drusus**, an Optimate who opposed the Grockei reforms, yet promised Italian citizenship, a promise later reneged. Efforts by the Optimates to move against the Equestrian rank turned this group into the backbone of the Italian Rebellion. Notably, a statement is made that the short-sighted obsession with electoral politics led to the most unnecessary war in Roman history.

[Drusus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Livius_Drusus_(tribune)) was the man at the center of the crisis, with opposition coming from Lucius Philippus. The Optimate meeting during this period became the basis for Cicero's Dialogues on the Orators. 

At Crassus's villa in September of 91, key Roman figures were present, like Rufus, Cota, Antonius, Scovola. These discussions led to the Italian Citizenship Bill being struck down, which was the final straw leading to the Italian revolt. Battles ensued, with rebels rallying behind the idea of either becoming citizens of the Republic (Civitas) or becoming independent (Libertas). They attacked the Latin colonies, seized control of the roads, cut off Romans' ability to communicate outside of their sphere, which caught the Romans off-guard.

Meanwhile, the Mattel splintered and dissolved, effectively ending their generation's run of Roman politics. Scaris died in 89, further disrupting Roman control. Coinciding with these events are the emergence of key figures including Quintus Sertorius, Marius, Pius, Cinna, and Sulla. Sulla, who was not involved in Saturninus' insurrection, returns to the scene. 

![Sulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla) eventually goes east to become the first Roman ambassador to sit down with the Parthians, heirs to the Persians. Battles against the Latins ensued, but they did not go well for Rome. Marius's nephew was killed, and Capio's son was assassinated. Marius was not effective in this area either, being subverted by his opponents.

Pompey Strabo, father of Pompey the Great, entered the fray, scoring a big win in Asculum but earns the nickname "the butcher of Asculum." The Senate proposed several reforms, including the Lex Julia and the Lex Plautia Pepria, both aimed at calming the Italian rebellion by offering Roman citizenship to participants not taking up arms and promising citizenship to those who were if they laid their weapons down.

Sulla led his army and moved along the coast into Samnium, scoring some victories. The war caused heavy casualties, crippled productivity, and triggered a monetary crisis across the Roman Empire. The final battle occurred at Apulia in early 88. Though it wasn't a decisive battle, the death of Quintus Silo led to the end of the Latin insurrection.
