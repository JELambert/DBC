# The Storm Before The Storm: Chapter Six - The Golden Earring

This chapter introduces **Lucius Cornelius Sulla** into the major characters' fold of this saga. He acts as a direct contrast to the character of Gaius Marius, embodying the Opitimates' wealth and entitlement, though also possessing a dynamic and charismatic persona. [Lucius Cornelius Sulla's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla)

* Sulla, raised in wealth, had an easier path to success compared to Marius. Yet, he was known for his exceptional talent in the army, and his popular appeal among Roman denizens.
* His prominent role in defeating Jugurtha, king of Numidia is highlighted. This victory, however, would set the foundation for friction between Marius and himself.

In parallel to this storyline, the narration shifts to the issues plaguing northern Rome due to the continuous threats from Kimberley tribes.

* Lucius Cassius Longinus, and Quintus Servilius Capio, two Roman generals, led unsuccessful campaigns against the tribes, leading to further losses for Rome.

Back to focusing on Africa, Sulla skillfully negotiates with King Bocchus of Mauritania, attempting to sway him away from Jugurtha and align with Rome.

* Sulla's negotiations payoff, as King Bocchus seizes Jugurtha and hands him over to Rome. This act marks the end of the war in Namibia.

Throughout these events, another character, Gnaeus Maximus, a *novus homo*, emerges in Rome, leading to one of the largest defeats in Roman history, the Battle of Arausio. His failure results from his arrogance, refusing to consolidate his forces with Capio's against the Cimbrians. 

The chapter culminates with Marius's striking victory in Rome, attributed to his successful campaign against Jugurtha. His triumph, however, is marred by discord, as Sulla's faction claims rightful credit for Jugurtha's defeat. This dispute would mark the inception of a bitter and nearly destructive rivalry between Marius and Sulla. 

This chapter ends with a sense of foreboding - the rivalry between Marius and Sulla might instigate Rome's downfall.
