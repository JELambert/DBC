# Storm Before the Storm Prologue 

The prologue to our book club selection, Storm Before the Storm, lays the foundation for our understanding of the rise and eventual fall of the Roman Empire. 

1. Here, we see how the story of Rome is initiated with the legend of **Romulus and Remus**[^1^]. By linking the city's birth to these mythic figures, we are introduced to the importance of the original Roman political structure. 

2. This structure is seemingly influenced by the **concept of three**, which frequently appears in Roman culture and politics: 

   * The single hegemon or dictator entity
   * The aristocracy
   * The common folk, or the democracy

   This trifecta resembles the American system of checks and balances, indicating the lasting influence of Roman thought.

3. The political dynamics seen across history are also unveiled. We are reminded that cycles of benign and tyrannical leadership, followed by popular rebellions, are common. Think of events such as the **French Revolution**[^2^] or the **American Revolution**[^3^].

4. We are introduced to the power players of the time: **Aemilianus**, the adopted member of the Scipio Africanus family – perhaps the most powerful in Rome, and **Mumius**, the new man who represents the common folk. These characters are positioned to pacify the Macedonians or Greeks in the East, and the Carthaginians in North Africa.
   
5. The prologue concludes with the Roman Empire at the height of its hegemony, mirroring the apex of Mount Olympus before the inevitable descent. Aemilianus, quoting from Homer, alludes to this upcoming downfall, paving the way for a discussion on the 'rot from within' the Empire. 

In a separate author's note, Mike Duncan makes intriguing comparisons between the progression of the Roman Empire and current American politics. He hypothesizes that America may currently be in its own 'Storm Before the Storm' period, preventing us from drawing too direct a comparison between the two entities just yet. 

This book, therefore, serves as a call to reflect on and learn from these historical cycles, using Rome as a beacon to navigate the murky waters of today's world.
