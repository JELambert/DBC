# The Storm Before the Storm, Chapter 3, Daggers in the Forum

## Gaius Gracchus

* Brother of Tiberius
* Known for his vehement oration
* Picks up his brother's mantle and supports many proposals like the **lex agraria**, making Italian allies citizens, etc.
* Becomes a tribune

## Gaius' Proposals and Actions

1. **Gaius got sent off to Sardinia**  
Used his oratory skills to drum up support from the locals, this worried the Senate, because of his burgeoning power. Was elected as a tribune easily.
2. **Reform package**  
    * Settled family business related to wrongs done to his brother
    * Restarting work on land commission, gave the commission power over all disputed boundaries
    * Created entire new communities of Italian allies. These new colonies stretched across Italy and other places and helped with trade
    * Improving and extending roads of Italy, connected many of the rural plebs
    * Secured a stable and cheap supply of grain for the plebs urbana
    * Addressed issues within the army legions, like deductions for clothing and arms
    * Brought more money into Rome from old domains in Asia
    * Curbed senatorial power by allowing tax farming contracts to be given to the equestrians, particularly the publicani companies
    * Granted new jurors and barred senators from serving on juries, also meant to served publicani interests.

These reforms ended up creating a coalition of **anti-senatorial groups**, such as the plebs urbana, the rural poor, the equestrians, and especially the publicani. This anti-elite coalition is expected to play a significant role in the future.

## Events Leading to Gaius' Downfall

* Gaius wins re-election for the second time but fails to make a significant mark in North Africa
* Fails in his bid to get elected for a third time 
* Election thrown out as fraudulent 
* Lucius Opimius wins the consulship

## Lucius Opimius 

* Suppressed the revolt in the Italian city of Fregalla in a horrid way, razed the city to the ground
* Known for his cruelty and oppression, takes advantage of a Grakan supporter murdering one of his servants
* Given authority by the Senate "to restore order", uses that to kill Marcus Flaccus and Gaius

## Impact

Gaius' head is filled with molten lead to make it heavier in order to claim the reward offered by Opimius, who had promised its weight in gold for the head. There is a methodical purge of all the Grakan supporters leading to an end similar to Tiberius.

This chapter underlines major oppression against a popular leader, an act which has been seen in previous chapters, too. It continues to illustrate the struggle between the "popular movement in Roman politics" and the "optimates", the senatorial elites. While the leaders of the popular group may change, the population that the coalition represents remains the same as they always stand by a leader who is promising benefits for them.
