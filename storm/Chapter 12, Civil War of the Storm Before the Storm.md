# Chapter 12, Civil War of the Storm Before the Storm

This chapter provides a comprehensive account of Sulla's campaign after his return from the East and the consequent civil war between him and some members aligned with Carbo ,who were in Rome at the time. 

1. **Building Conflict:** Carbo started raising an army in 84, hoping to leverage the fear that Sulla would revoke Italian citizenship to recruit men. Unlike Carbo, who drew on the full might of the Roman infrastructure for his efforts, Sulla, returning from the East, did not have the same access.

2. **Key Personalities:** Some of the prominent personalities during the conflict were;
    * Gnaeus Pompeius (aka Pompey the Great), the son of Pompey Strabo. Despite his young age (early 20s), Pompey was a highly coveted ally given his inherited client network.

    * Carbo became the proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul, similar to the roles that Caesar and Marc Antony would assume in the following generation. To replace him as consuls were Asiaticus and Norbonus, the other main generals in the Civil War.

    * Sulla also had the support of Metellus Pius (the lone son of the Metellan faction bringing his client network) and Marcus Crassus who would later become a significant rival to Pompey.

3. **End of Social War:** Sulla's arrival marked the end of the social war between the Romans and Italians as he clearly stated he wouldn't revoke Italian citizenship, undermining some of Carbo's recruitment tactics. 

4. **Tactics and Unfolding Events:** As time went on Sulla managed to splinter Asiaticus's forces, as a result, no fight was necessary as Asiaticus's entire army defected. This pattern repeated when Asiaticus faced Pompey in Pisonim. 

    * Changing Sides: Sertorius defected to Spain, foreseeing the turn of the battle, becoming one of the few not defeated by Sulla. 
    
    * Marius's son, Gaius Marius the Younger, who also held the consul office became an enemy of Sulla but was unsuccessful in his efforts. Similarly, Carbo in Cisalpine Gaul was trying to defeat Pompey, while Marius the Younger led his legions to Campania to face Sulla. Marius the Younger was ultimately besieged by Sulla following the defeat of his armies. 

5. **Towards the End:** The impending defeat was clear with Rome preparing to evacuate. A list was convened with Praetors aiming to assassinate all pro-Sullans, leading to another case of political violence within the Senate chambers. Sulla then faced legions loyal to Carbo in the north, also battling against forces raised by the Samite General Telecinus.

6. **End of Conflict:** Sulla and Crassus's forces attacked them resulting in a decisive defeat. The conflict ended as they defeated forces loyal to Carbo in the north, the Samites and Lucanians in areas around Rome. While a single legion remained in Spain, Sulla implied control over Rome, concluding the civil war.
