# The Storm Before the Storm: Chapter 2 - The Stepchildren of Rome

This note aims to untangle the contents of the second chapter in the book "The Storm Before the Storm, focusing on the key groups and events that are referred to as the '*Stepchildren of Rome.*'

## Major Groups

There are a few central groups discussed in this chapter. 

- **Slaves:** Considered the lowest class in Roman society.
- **The Lower Two Classes:** These include the Latin rights group and the allies within Rome. They hold a higher rank than slaves but sit below full Roman citizens in the societal hierarchy. 
- **The Equestrians:** Middle class that held vast economic power.\
  Specifically, a subset known as '**publicani**,' responsible for logistical acts related to the Roman government, including the fulfillment of contracts for resources during wars.
- **Plebs Urbana:** Another group,composed of individuals from different classes including slaves.

## Key Players & Events

- **Scipio Aemilianus:** Starts this chapter after subjugating the rebellion in Numantia. Interestingly, upon his return to Rome, he was viewed as an out-of-touch noble, a damaging blow to his reputation.
- **First Servile War in Sicily:** A major slave revolt led by Eunice, a Syrian conman who ascended to become king, and a Sicilian slave named Cleon.
- **The death of King Attalus:** King Attalus's bequeathed fortune to Rome was a significant incident that led to further uprisings, highlighting the complexity of Roman control over annexed provinces.
- **Latin Rights & Allies:** More rights were afforded to the Latin rights group than the allies. However, their rights still significantly fell short when compared to full Roman citizens.
- **Land Commission:** Further efforts by the commission to annex and redistribute public lands were slowed down due to numerous claims over the lands adjacent to Italian territories.
- **Death of Scipio Aemilianus:** His sudden death on the eve of his plans to dismantle the Lex Agraria stands as an intriguing historical footnote.

## Implications and Aftermath

While Scipio Aemilianus's life became the epitome for future generations of Romans to follow, his death also marked an end of an era. His ability to control the assembly, raise a legion of soldiers through his personal client network, and employ luxuries paved the way for the rise of individuals like Marius, Sulla, and Caesar.

Meanwhile, the tension brewing amongst the 'stepchildren of Rome' would become an instrumental force contributing to the downfall of the Roman Empire.
