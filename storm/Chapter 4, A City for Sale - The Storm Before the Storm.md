# Chapter 4, A City for Sale - The Storm Before the Storm

This chapter introduces several new characters in the narrative of Rome's history.

## New Characters
- **Gaius Marius**: A "new man" or *novohomus,* though debate remains on the authenticity of his humble beginnings.
- **The Metelli** (*the power brokers*): A large influential family with numerous political positions - consuls, tribunes, praetors. 
- **Marcus Aemilius Scaris**:  A Metelli ally, known as a backroom operator. Later becomes a senator and the lead of the Metelli faction.
- **Lucius Crassus**: Regarded as the greatest orator of Rome.
- **Marcus Antonius**: A friend to Crassus, politcal ally, and another of the Metelli's recruits.

*Major Events*

- Rome's campaign against the Gauls leads to the establishment of a principal base in [Aix-en-Provence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aix-en-Provence). 
- The Gallic Wars climax near Avignon with one of Rome's greatest victories.
- Lucius Crassus advocates for the founding of a colony, **Narbo** (Narbonne), opening the space for the construction of the Via Domitia. 
- Marius introduces a bill to redesign voting stalls, breaking from the Metelli faction, which leads to a reduction in his influence and political standing.

Moving from Rome into the kingdom of Numidia (modern-day Algeria), the stage further strides into an expansive narrative shadowed by corruption. 

- King Mesipsa dies, leaving a power vacuum that his illegitimate nephew **Jugartha** attempts to fill. 
- Jugartha, having previous allegiances with Rome, starts bribing Roman senators, revealing the depth of corruption within the Roman Senate and Assembly. 
- Scaris tries to execute peace negotiations, inflaming the *plebs urbana* even more. 
- The chapter ends with Jugartha proclaiming, "a city for sale and doomed to speedy destruction if it finds a purchaser," leaving a strong premise for the following chapter.

*Additional Notes*

- There were overestimated 120,000 Gallic losses from the victory near Avignon during the Gallic Wars. 
- The Via Domitia linked Italy to Spain, parts of which still visible along the southern coast of France. 
- More political drama ensues in Numidia as Jugartha continues attempts on other leaders' lives.
