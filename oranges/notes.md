# Drunk Book Club: Oranges by John McPhee

## Preface and Chapter One: Oranges

**Summary:** This gives a history of oranges. Oranges are ancient fruits, having been cultivated for over 4,000 years. The narrative travels from ancient texts mentioning oranges to their eventual spread across the world, facilitated by explorers, traders, and conquerors. We’re given a lot of information on the properties of different varieties as well as details on the cultural and economic impact of oranges around the world and across time.

### Interesting details:
- Citrus seeds can grow different kinds of citrus, wow
- The way different cultures around the world eat oranges is fascinating. I have a clip to play from our Irish friend Simon because I asked him about the oranges in the theater.
- I did not know that orange juice for breakfast was uniquely American
- California outgrew Florida in oranges until 1949
- Appearance has nothing to do with ripeness
- "Tree ripened" oranges are a scam. They can only ripen on trees.

### Comments:
- When I had meningitis in Jan/Feb 2022, my grandma in FL sent me oranges that were delicious
- I'm just going to blindly choose oranges at the store from now on because appearance doesn't matter at all, or just buy from Trader Joe’s — they know what they're doing.

### Random asides:
- I heard the difference between "gourmet" coffee and "commodity" coffee is that the gourmet stuff is picked by hand, and the commodity stuff is picked after the tree sours and the tree shakes, bringing all the beans to the ground regardless of ripeness.
- Florida growers fly helicopters over orange groves to shake off frost — similar to vine slopes or peach farms in Missouri or Michigan.
- I believe that adults should only drink orange juice if it is mixed with liquor. However, John Boham drank 4 quadruple screwdrivers for breakfast that catapulted him into a day-long drinking spree that left him dead. It always struck me that orange juice might be the mixer that best covers up the taste of cheap liquor.

## Chapter Two: Orange Men

**Summary:** Explores the cultivation of oranges and the intricacies of the citrus industry. McPhee delves into the efforts of growers, the challenges they face, and the innovations that have shaped modern orange farming. The chapter discusses the technological advancements, like specialized machinery, that have been developed to cater to the needs of the orange market.

### Interesting details:
- Everyone drinks concentrate, even orange growers 
- “In Florida, most orange trees are grown on lemon root. In CA, nearly all are grown on orange roots."
- Rootstock is where one tree grows, you take it out, plant another tree that takes over its roots. I didn’t know it worked like that, but makes sense.
- The orange industry is highly regulated to save growers from spiraling quality downwards
- Sinkholes are consequence/environmental phenomenon that mining exacerbates, and they allow cold air to move in
- Florida citrus industry was decimated by a 1895 freeze
- Temperature inversion is when trap cool air (and pollution) in low lying areas. I never thought about it killing orange trees, it sucks in cities.

### Comments:
- He writes forever about trying to get fresh orange juice, and on page 21, he buys his own juicer and does it himself, but doesn’t even remark on how it tastes: "It had been a long day."
- On page 25, he’s flying with that guy whose flying for the first time. Reminds me of *Coming into the Country* by McPhee where he’s always flying around Alaska with random people
- I see some correlations between the “concentrate boom” and the ethanol mandate with corn where so much more land goes into production and probably has some bad ecological benefits. Not a fan of orange juice.
- Cornell apples make an appearance on page 23.
- If you have to eat fruit with sugar like maple syrup the fruit sucks – like with grapefruit on page 38
- The meteorologists’ role in this industry is interesting. I didn’t realize much could be done about protecting fruit in a freeze.

## Chapter Three: Citrus Sinensis

**Summary:** This chapter zooms in on the scientific and botanical aspects of the orange, particularly the sweet orange, which is botanically referred to as "Citrus sinensis." It outlines the botanical background, origin and spread, genetic diversity, and cultural implications of oranges.

### Interesting details:
- This chapter kind of felt like an interlude. It was cool for a summary about how orange trade grew with history, but I didn’t have anything too interesting to discuss. 

### Comments:
- This reminded me of the book “Plagues and People” – telling the story of civilization through the lenses of a particular thing. In that case, disease, in this case, oranges. Obviously oranges did a lot less driving of the spread of civilization or whatever, but that book is like 300 pages long, and this chapter was ten. 

## Chapter Four: Orangeries

**Summary:** This chapter delves into the history and significance of structures known as orangeries. These are buildings specifically designed to house and protect orange trees during colder months in regions where oranges wouldn't typically survive the winter.

### Interesting details:
- They planted oranges as “scurvy prevention stations” for trans-Atlantic voyages 
- Oranges as a symbol of wealth in the renaissance (and apparently 1970’s Ireland)

### Comments:
- Kind of felt like another interlude. Short, interesting, but not much to discuss. 
- The bit about “The Last Supper” was interesting

### Random asides:
- They should make a separate category for important monarchs. I don't want to have to calculate Roman numerals to understand how important a person is e.g. Louis XIV just call him the fourteenth king or whatever. 

## Chapter Five: Indian River

**Summary:** This chapter delves into the renowned citrus-growing region of the Indian River in Florida, emphasizing its distinct reputation and the quality of the oranges it produces. It starts with the pioneers that moved in in the mid 19th Century, talks about the branding of the area’s oranges, the challenges the area has seen, and highlights the lives of the people that helped cultivate that area.

### Interesting details:
- The NASA site he describes on Merritt Island becomes the Kennedy Space Center
- The “river” is just a lagoon system 

### Comments:
- Old people have been moving to Florida since 1842 apparently (Page 91)
- The irrigation system they described makes me cringe from an ecological standpoint. 
- "Midwesterners don't want oranges, they want tomatoes" because they only buy juicy ones
- The auctioning strategy is really interesting - making it timed before the auction ends. This is the first I've heard of this strategy, whether a candle or timer being used. I've always seen it to be just go to the highest bidder and you get like 5-10 seconds to up-bid.

### Random asides:
- One time I went to a ranch in inland FL the guy had his dogs trained to freak out at rattlesnakes. I don’t know why people think guns are good at killing snakes. Seems like this guy had it figured out with the shovel.
- My Dad told me I shouldn't root for Syracuse because they were called the "Orangemen" and that was an anti-Catholic thing to do, but I was 10 and I liked Carmelo. 
- Wild they've been adding dye to stuff for so long—I just had a conversation with Rachel about how food dye could be a cause of early puberty and literally making Americans shorter. I’m not sure why they would need to add dye and wax to these products, and I didn’t realized they had been doing it for so long.
- I wish we could collectively just become cool with ugly looking food. Reminds me of eggs which are washed, which makes it necessary to cool them in transportation and storage. Unwashed eggs are good for more than a year in room temp if handled rightly.
- Orange peels don't need the same extreme level of washing! The peel is on the outside! But once someone does it, people will just buy the cleaner one.
- I met a guy at a bike ride that wrote a book inspired by this book titled "Meditations on Killing and Eating" about the meat industry, and the way Chapter 5 ended was the first time I really thought about that. Chapter 5 was really about how the oranges get processed and sent to consumers - in all its ugly ways.

## Chapter 6: Degrees Brix

**Summary:** This is a deep dive into the science and economics underpinning the orange juice industry, especially as it pertains to measuring the sweetness and quality of the juice. We also read about the intricate balance between science, technology, economics, and consumer preferences in the vibrant world of orange juice, offering readers a comprehensive look at the beverage that has become a breakfast staple for many.

### Interesting details:
- The Brix scale measures sugar content in liquids and becomes very important with the rise of juice concentrate.
- Saw the transformation of the goal to be good oranges to “pounds solid” or “pounds of sugar.”  
- Technological innovations helped spur the concentrate industry and allowed for more of the poorer quality oranges to be used.
- The whole concentration process is interesting.

### Comments:
- This guy going on and on about being from the whole state of Florida to being "born in an alligator swamp" actually being from Peoria, IL is like *chef's kiss* perfect.
- A lot of Big Ag and corruption in this chapter, interesting to learn some details about that from that time. 
- They used to fine people for adding sugar to orange juice?! Where did we go wrong?
- This MacDowell character seems like Nucky Thompson (Boardwalk Empire) of Citrus.
- Maybe Americans are uniquely addicted to sugar.
- "We are growing chemicals now, not oranges" (page 136) is some dystopian shit.
- The whole chapter is pretty sad. Linking all the by-products of this industry with other shitty industries like rubber, cattle feed, oil, etc.
- Naming the town with the plant “Plant City” is a bit on the nose.
- This chapter was a detailed description of how we got to a point where everyone drinks shitty sugary orange juice and a lot of people think it’s actually good for them.

## Chapter 7: Orange Baron

**Summary:** This chapter shifts the focus to the individuals and families who've built empires within the orange industry, specifically highlighting the influential role of Ben Hill Griffin, Jr., a prominent figure in the world of orange cultivation in Florida.

### Interesting details:
- This was just kind of a story about a guy. Started small, got bigger and pretty powerful. 

### Comments:
- Frostproof, FL is close to where my parents have a farm and my mom stays in the winter, Sebring, which is mentioned when talking about football scores. They call the farm “Scrub Pine” which also made an appearance. Must be a lot of them.
- Wild that this dude stuffed his whole bull 
- Imagine leaving to sell oranges and coming back with a load of beans that no one wanted.
- Some of this reminded me of dairy farms. Super remote areas that need a lot of people, so there are these random villages that pop up but nothing like stores or schools to support them.
